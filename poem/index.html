	<p>
The dragon is in the street dancing beneath windows<br/>
   pasted with colored squares, past the man<br/>
who leans into the phone booth’s red pagoda, past<br/>
   crates of doves and roosters veiled<br/>
</p>
<p>
until dawn. Fireworks complicate the streets<br/>
   with sulphur as people exchange gold<br/>
and silver foil, money to appease ghosts<br/>
   who linger, needy even in death. I am<br/>
</p>
<p>
almost invisible. Hands could pass through me<br/>
   effortlessly. This is how it is<br/>
to be so alien that my name falls from me, grows<br/>
   untranslatable as the shop signs,<br/>
</p>
<p>
the odors of ginseng and black fungus that idle<br/>
   in the stairwell, the corridor where<br/>
the doors are blue months ajar. Hands<br/>
   gesture in the smoke, the partial moon<br/>
</p>
<p>
of a face. For hours the soft numeric<br/>
   click of mah-jongg tiles drifts<br/>
down the hallway where languid Mai trails<br/>
   her musk of sex and narcotics.<br/>
</p>
<p>
There is no grief in this, only the old year<br/>
   consuming itself, the door knob blazing<br/>
in my hand beneath the lightbulb’s electric jewel.<br/>
   Between voices and fireworks<br/>
</p>
<p>
wind works bricks to dust—<i>hush</i>, <i>hush</i>—<br/>
   no language I want to learn. I can touch<br/>
the sill worn by hands I’ll never know<br/>
   in this room with its low table<br/>
</p>
<p>
where I brew chrysanthemum tea. The sign<br/>
   for Jade Palace sheds green corollas<br/>
on the floor. It’s dangerous to stand here<br/>
   in the chastening glow, darkening<br/>
</p>
<p>
my eyes in the mirror with the gulf of the rest<br/>
   of my life widening away from me, waiting<br/>
for the man I married to pass beneath<br/>
   the sign of the building, to climb<br/>
</p>
<p>
the five flights and say his Chinese name for me.<br/>
   He’ll rise up out of the puzzling streets<br/>
where men pass bottles of rice liquor, where<br/>
   the new year is liquor, the black bottle<br/>
</p>
<p>
the whole district is waiting for, like<br/>
   some benevolent arrest—the moment<br/>
when men and women turn to each other and dissolve<br/>
   each bad bet, every sly mischance,<br/>
</p>
<p>
the dalliance of hands. They turn in lamplight<br/>
   the way I turn now. Wai Min is in the doorway.<br/>
He brings fish. He brings lotus root.<br/>
   He brings me ghost money.<br/>
